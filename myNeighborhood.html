            <h3><strong>Echo Park:</strong></h3>
            <p class="parag">As one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, California, Echo park is full of history. It's located halfway between downtown and Hollywood. Established in 1892 as Edendale, this was the original center of filmmaking in the west coast. Echo Park Lake, at the center of the neighborhood, is one of the most famous postcards of the city. In the last few decades, gentrification has transformed it from an infamous spot into a trendy destination, attracting many creative types. Echo Park has a high population density that is very diverse. This makes the neighborhood a microcosm of the city of Los Angeles itself.</p>
